\bv{2}{for the truth’s sake which abideth in us, and it shall be with us for ever:}
\bv{3}{Grace, mercy, peace shall be with us, from God the Father, and from Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.}

\bv{4}{I rejoice greatly that I have found \supptext{certain} of thy children walking in truth, even as we received commandment from the Father.}
\bv{5}{And now I beseech thee, lady, not as though I wrote to thee a new commandment, but that which we had from the beginning, that we love one another.}
\bv{6}{And this is love, that we should walk after his commandments. This is the commandment, even as ye heard from the beginning, that ye should walk in it.}
\chapsec{Doctrine: The Test of Reality}
\bv{7}{For many deceivers are gone forth into the world, \supptext{even} they that confess not that Jesus Christ cometh in the flesh. This is the deceiver and the antichrist.}
\bv{8}{Look to yourselves, that ye lose not the things which we have wrought, but that ye receive a full reward.}
\bv{9}{Whosoever goeth onward and abideth not in the teaching of Christ, hath not God: he that abideth in the teaching, the same hath both the Father and the Son.}
\bv{10}{If any one cometh unto you, and bringeth not this teaching, receive him not into \supptext{your} house, and give him no greeting:}
\bv{11}{for he that giveth him greeting partaketh in his evil works.}
\chapsec{Superscription}
\bv{12}{Having many things to write unto you, I would not \supptext{write them} with paper and ink: but I hope to come unto you, and to speak face to face, that your joy may be made full.}
\bv{13}{The children of thine elect sister salute thee.}
