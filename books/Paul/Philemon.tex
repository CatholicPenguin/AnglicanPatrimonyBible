\bv{2}{and to Apphia our sister, and to Archippus our fellow-soldier, and to the church in thy house:}
\bv{3}{Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.}
\chapsec{Character of Philemon}
\bv{4}{I thank my God always, making mention of thee in my prayers,}
\bv{5}{hearing of thy love, and of the faith which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all the saints;}
\bv{6}{that the fellowship of thy faith may become effectual, in the knowledge of every good thing which is in you, unto Christ.}
\bv{7}{For I had much joy and comfort in thy love, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through thee, brother.}
\chapsec{Intercession for Onesimus}
\bv{8}{Wherefore, though I have all boldness in Christ to enjoin thee that which is befitting,}
\bv{9}{yet for love’s sake I rather beseech, being such a one as Paul the aged, and now a prisoner also of Christ Jesus:}
\bv{10}{I beseech thee for my child, whom I have begotten in my bonds, Onesimus,}
\bv{11}{who once was unprofitable to thee, but now is profitable to thee and to me:}
\bv{12}{whom I have sent back to thee in his own person, that is, my very heart:}
\bv{13}{whom I would fain have kept with me, that in thy behalf he might minister unto me in the bonds of the gospel:}
\bv{14}{but without thy mind I would do nothing; that thy goodness should not be as of necessity, but of free will.}

\bv{15}{For perhaps he was therefore parted \supptext{from thee} for a season, that thou shouldest have him for ever;}
\bv{16}{no longer as a servant, but more than a servant, a brother beloved, specially to me, but how much rather to thee, both in the flesh and in the Lord.}
\bv{17}{If then thou countest me a partner, receive him as myself.}
\bv{18}{But if he hath wronged thee at all, or oweth \supptext{thee} aught, put that to mine account;}
\bv{19}{I Paul write it with mine own hand, I will repay it: that I say not unto thee that thou owest to me even thine own self besides.}
\bv{20}{Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord: refresh my heart in Christ.}
\bv{21}{Having confidence in thine obedience I write unto thee, knowing that thou wilt do even beyond what I say.}
\chapsec{Salutations \& Conclusion}
\bv{22}{But withal prepare me also a lodging: for I hope that through your prayers I shall be granted unto you.}
\bv{23}{Epaphras, my fellow-prisoner in Christ Jesus, saluteth thee;}
\bv{24}{\supptext{and so do} Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, Luke, my fellow-workers.}
\bv{25}{The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.}
