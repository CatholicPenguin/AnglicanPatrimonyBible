\lettrine[image=true, lines=4, findent=3pt, nindent=0pt]{O.eps}{} LORD Almighty,\mcomm{that art in heaven} thou God of our fathers, of Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and of their righteous seed;
\bv{2}{who hast made heaven and earth, with all the ornament\mcomm{order or array (Gen. 2:1 LXX)} thereof;}
\bv{3}{who hast bound the sea by the word of thy commandment; who hast shut up the deep, and sealed it by thy terrible and glorious name;}
\bv{4}{whom all things fear, yea, tremble before thy power;}
\bv{5}{for the majesty of thy glory cannot be borne, and the anger of thy threatening toward sinners is importable:}
\bv{6}{thy merciful promise is unmeasurable and unsearchable;}
\bv{7}{for thou art the Lord Most High, of great compassion, longsuffering and abundant in mercy, and repentest of the evils of men.}
\par
\bv{8}{Thou, O Lord, according to thy great goodness hast promised repentance and forgiveness to them that have sinned against thee: and of thine infinite mercies\mcomm{Thou hast promised that repentance shall be the way for them to return to thee.} hast appointed repentance unto sinners, that they may be saved. Thou therefore, O Lord, that art the God of the just, hast not appointed repentance to the just, to Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob,\mcomm{He calls their sins nothing, but attributes unto them righteousness.} which have not sinned against thee; but thou hast appointed repentance unto me that am a sinner:}
\bv{9}{for I have sinned above the number of the sands of the sea.}
\par
My transgressions are multiplied, O Lord: my transgressions are multiplied, and I am not worthy to behold and see the height of heaven for the multitude of mine iniquities.
\bv{10}{I am bowed down with many iron bands, that I cannot lift up mine head by reason of my sins, neither have I any respite: for I have provoked thy wrath, and done that which is evil before thee: I did not thy will, neither kept I thy commandments: I have set up abominations, and have multiplied detestable things\mcomm{stumbling-blocks}.}
\par
\bv{11}{Now therefore I bow the knee of mine heart, beseeching thee of grace.}
\bv{12}{I have sinned, O Lord, I have sinned, and I acknowledge mine iniquities:}
\bv{13}{but, I humbly beseech thee, forgive me, O Lord, forgive me, and destroy me not with mine iniquities. Be not angry with me for ever, by reserving evil for me; neither condemn me into the lower parts of the earth. For thou, O Lord\mcomm{O God}, art the God of them that repent;}
\bv{14}{and in me thou wilt shew all thy goodness: for thou wilt save me, that am unworthy, according to thy great mercy.}
\par
\bv{15}{And I will praise thee for ever all the days of my life: for all the host of heaven doth sing thy praise, and thine is the glory for ever and ever. Amen.}
