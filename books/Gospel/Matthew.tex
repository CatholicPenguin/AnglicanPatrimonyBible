\bv{19}{And Joseph her husband, being a righteous man, and not willing to make her a public example, was minded to put her away privily.}
\bv{20}{But when he thought on these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream, saying, ``Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost.}
\bv{21}{And she shall bring forth a son; and thou shalt call his name {\scshape Jesus}; for it is he that shall save his people from their sins.''}

\bv{3}{And when Herod the king heard it, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.}

Art in no wise least among the princes of Judah:
For out of thee shall come forth a governor,
Who shall be shepherd of my people Israel.}}
\bv{7}{Then Herod privily called the Wise-men, and learned of them exactly what time the star appeared.}
\bv{8}{And he sent them to Bethlehem, and said, ``Go and search out exactly concerning the young child; and when ye have found \supptext{him}, bring me word, that I also may come and worship him.''}
\par
\bv{9}{And they, having heard the king, went their way; and lo, the star, which they saw in the east, went before them, till it came and stood over where the young child was.}

\bv{11}{And they came into the house and saw the young child with Mary his mother; and they fell down and worshipped him; and opening their treasures they offered unto him gifts, gold and frankincense and myrrh.}

Weeping and great mourning,
Rachel weeping for her children;

Make ye ready the way of the Lord,
Make his paths straight.}
\bv{4}{Now John himself had his raiment of camel's hair, and a leathern girdle about his loins; and his food was locusts and wild honey.}
\bv{5}{Then went out unto him Jerusalem, and all Judæa, and all the region round about the Jordan;}

\bv{7}{But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism, he said unto them, ``Ye offspring of vipers, who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?}
\bv{8}{Bring forth therefore fruit worthy of repentance:}
\bv{9}{and think not to say within yourselves, `We have Abraham to our father:' for I say unto you, that God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham.}
\bv{10}{And even now the axe lieth at the root of the trees: every tree therefore that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.}
\bv{11}{I indeed baptise you in water unto repentance: but he that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear: he shall baptise you in the Holy Ghost and \supptext{in} fire:}
\bv{12}{whose fan is in his hand, and he will thoroughly cleanse his threshing-floor; and he will gather his wheat into the garner, but the chaff he will burn up with unquenchable fire.''}
\chapsec{Baptism of Jesus}
\bv{13}{Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to the Jordan unto John, to be baptised of him.}
\bv{14}{But John would have hindered him, saying, ``I have need to be baptised of thee, and comest thou to me?''}
\bv{15}{But Jesus answering said unto him, ``Suffer \supptext{it} now: for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness.'' Then he suffereth him.}
\bv{16}{And Jesus, when he was baptised, went up straightway from the water: and lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending as a dove, and coming upon him;}

\bv{4}{But he answered and said, \redlet{``It is written,}}
\otQuote{Deut. 8:3}{\redlet{Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.''}}

\otQuote{Ps. 91:12}{On their hands they shall bear thee up,
Lest haply thou dash thy foot against a stone.''}

\bv{69}{Now Peter was sitting without in the court: and a maid came unto him, saying, ``Thou also wast with Jesus the Galilæan.''}
\bv{70}{But he denied before them all, saying, ``I know not what thou sayest.''}
\bv{71}{And when he was gone out into the porch, another \supptext{maid} saw him, and saith unto them that were there, ``This man also was with Jesus of Nazareth.''}
\bv{72}{And again he denied with an oath, ``I know not the man.''}
\bv{73}{And after a little while they that stood by came and said to Peter, ``Of a truth thou also art \supptext{one} of them; for thy speech maketh thee known.''}
\bv{74}{Then began he to curse and to swear, ``I know not the man.'' And straightway the cock crew.}
\bv{75}{And Peter remembered the word which Jesus had said, \redlet{``Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.''} And he went out, and wept bitterly.}

\bv{2}{and they bound him, and led him away, and delivered him up to Pilate the governor.}
\chapsec{Judas Iscariot's Proud Repentance}
\bv{3}{Then Judas, who betrayed him, when he saw that he was condemned, repented himself, and brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders,}
\bv{4}{saying, ``I have sinned in that I betrayed innocent blood.'' But they said, ``What is that to us? see thou \supptext{to it}.''}
\bv{5}{And he cast down the pieces of silver into the sanctuary, and departed; and he went away and hanged himself.}
\bv{6}{And the chief priests took the pieces of silver, and said, ``It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, since it is the price of blood.''}
\bv{7}{And they took counsel, and bought with them the potter's field, to bury strangers in.}
\bv{8}{Wherefore that field was called, ``The field of blood,'' unto this day.}
\bv{9}{Then was fulfilled that which was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet, saying,}
\otQuote{Zech. 11:13}{And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that was priced, whom \supptext{certain} of the children of Israel did price; \bv{10}{and they gave them for the potter's field, as the Lord appointed me.}}
\chapsec{Jesus Interrogated by Pilate}
\bv{11}{Now Jesus stood before the governor: and the governor asked him, saying, ``Art thou the King of the Jews?'' And Jesus said unto him, \redlet{``Thou sayest.''}}
\bv{12}{And when he was accused by the chief priests and elders, he answered nothing.}
\bv{13}{Then saith Pilate unto him, ``Hearest thou not how many things they witness against thee?''}
\bv{14}{And he gave him no answer, not even to one word: insomuch that the governor marvelled greatly.}
\chapsec{Jesus or Barabbas?}
\bv{15}{Now at the feast the governor was wont to release unto the multitude one prisoner, whom they would.}
\bv{16}{And they had then a notable prisoner, called Barabbas.}
\bv{17}{When therefore they were gathered together, Pilate said unto them, ``Whom will ye that I release unto you? Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Christ?''}
\bv{18}{For he knew that for envy they had delivered him up.}
\bv{19}{And while he was sitting on the judgement-seat, his wife sent unto him, saying, ``Have thou nothing to do with that righteous man; for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him.''}
\bv{20}{Now the chief priests and the elders persuaded the multitudes that they should ask for Barabbas, and destroy Jesus.}
\chapsec{Jewish Apostacy}
\bv{21}{But the governor answered and said unto them, ``Which of the two will ye that I release unto you?'' And they said, ``Barabbas.''}
\bv{22}{Pilate saith unto them, ``What then shall I do unto Jesus who is called Christ?'' They all say, ``Let him be crucified.''}
\bv{23}{And he said, ``Why, what evil hath he done?'' But they cried out exceedingly, saying, ``Let him be crucified.''}
\bv{24}{So when Pilate saw that he prevailed nothing, but rather that a tumult was arising, he took water, and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, ``I am innocent of the blood of this righteous man; see ye \supptext{to it}.''}
\bv{25}{And all the people answered and said, ``His blood \supptext{be} on us, and on our children.''}
\chapsec{Barabbas Released}
\bv{26}{Then released he unto them Barabbas; but Jesus he scourged and delivered to be crucified.}

\bv{27}{Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the Prætorium, and gathered unto him the whole band.}
\bv{28}{And they stripped him, and put on him a scarlet robe.}
\bv{29}{And they platted a crown of thorns and put it upon his head, and a reed in his right hand; and they kneeled down before him, and mocked him, saying, ``Hail, King of the Jews!''}
\bv{30}{And they spat upon him, and took the reed and smote him on the head.}
\bv{31}{And when they had mocked him, they took off from him the robe, and put on him his garments, and led him away to crucify him.}
\bv{32}{And as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name: him they compelled to go \supptext{with them}, that he might bear his cross.}
\chapsec{The Crucifixion}
\bv{33}{And when they were come unto a place called Golgotha, that is to say, ``The place of a skull,''}

\bv{38}{Then are there crucified with him two robbers, one on the right hand and one on the left.}
\bv{39}{And they that passed by railed on him, wagging their heads,}
\bv{40}{and saying, ``Thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three days, save thyself: if thou art the Son of God, come down from the cross.''}
\bv{41}{In like manner also the chief priests mocking \supptext{him}, with the scribes and elders, said,}
\bv{42}{``He saved others; himself he cannot save. He is the King of Israel; let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe on him.}
\bv{43}{He trusteth on God; let him deliver him now, if he desireth him: for he said, `I am the Son of God.'{''}}

\bv{49}{And the rest said, ``Let be; let us see whether Elijah cometh to save him.''}

\chapsec{The Fulfilment of the Law}
\bv{51}{And behold, the veil of the temple was rent in two from the top to the bottom; and the earth did quake; and the rocks were rent;}
\bv{52}{and the tombs were opened; and many bodies of the saints that had fallen asleep were raised;}
\bv{53}{and coming forth out of the tombs after his resurrection they entered into the holy city and appeared unto many.}
\bv{54}{Now the centurion, and they that were with him watching Jesus, when they saw the earthquake, and the things that were done, feared exceedingly, saying, ``Truly this was the Son of God.''}
\bv{55}{And many women were there beholding from afar, who had followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering unto him:}
\bv{56}{among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.}

\bv{57}{And when even was come, there came a rich man from Arimathæa, named Joseph, who also himself was Jesus' disciple:}

\bv{62}{Now on the morrow, which is \supptext{the day} after the Preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees were gathered together unto Pilate,}

\bv{64}{Command therefore that the sepulchre be made sure until the third day, lest haply his disciples come and steal him away, and say unto the people, `He is risen from the dead:' and the last error will be worse than the first.''}
\bv{65}{Pilate said unto them, ``Ye have a guard: go, make it \supptext{as} sure as ye can.''}
\bv{66}{So they went, and made the sepulchre sure, sealing the stone, the guard being with them.}

\bv{2}{And behold, there was a great earthquake; for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled away the stone, and sat upon it.}
\bv{3}{His appearance was as lightning, and his raiment white as snow:}
\bv{4}{and for fear of him the watchers did quake, and became as dead men.}
\bv{5}{And the angel answered and said unto the women, ``Fear not ye; for I know that ye seek Jesus, who hath been crucified.}
\bv{6}{He is not here; for he is risen, even as he said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay.}
\bv{7}{And go quickly, and tell his disciples, `He is risen from the dead;' and lo, he goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye see him: lo, I have told you.''}
\bv{8}{And they departed quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy, and ran to bring his disciples word.}

\bv{11}{Now while they were going, behold, some of the guard came into the city, and told unto the chief priests all the things that were come to pass.}
