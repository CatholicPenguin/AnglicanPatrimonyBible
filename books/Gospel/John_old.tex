\lettrine[image=true, lines=4, findent=3pt, nindent=0pt]{I-Jn.eps}{n} the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
\bv{2}{The same was in the beginning with God.}
\bv{3}{All things were made through him; and without him was not anything made that hath been made.}
\bv{4}{In him was life; and the life was the light of men.}
\bv{5}{And the light shineth in the darkness; and the darkness apprehended it not.}
\bv{6}{There came a man, sent from God, whose name was John.}
\bv{7}{The same came for witness, that he might bear witness of the light, that all might believe through him.}
\bv{8}{He was not the light, but \supptext{came} that he might bear witness of the light.}
\bv{9}{There was the true light, \supptext{even the light} which lighteth every man, coming into the world.}
\bv{10}{He was in the world, and the world was made through him, and the world knew him not.}
\bv{11}{He came unto his own, and they that were his own received him not.}
\bv{12}{But as many as received him, to them gave he the right to become children of God, \supptext{even} to them that believe on his name:}
\bv{13}{who were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.}
\bv{14}{And the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us (and we beheld his glory, glory as of the only begotten from the Father), full of grace and truth.}
\chapsec{The Testimony of St. John the Baptist}
\bv{15}{John beareth witness of him, and crieth, saying, ``This was he of whom I said, `He that cometh after me is become before me:' for he was before me.''}
\bv{16}{For of his fulness we all received, and grace for grace.}
\bv{17}{For the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.}
\bv{18}{No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten God, who is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared \supptext{him}.}
\bv{19}{And this is the witness of John, when the Jews sent unto him from Jerusalem priests and Levites to ask him, ``Who art thou?''}
\bv{20}{And he confessed, and denied not; and he confessed, ``I am not the Christ.''}
\bv{21}{And they asked him, ``What then? Art thou Elijah?'' And he saith, ``I am not.'' ``Art thou the prophet?'' And he answered, ``No.''}
\bv{22}{They said therefore unto him, ``Who art thou? that we may give an answer to them that sent us. What sayest thou of thyself?''}
\bv{23}{He said, \mref{Is. 40:3}``I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord,'' as said Isaiah the prophet.}
\bv{24}{And they had been sent from the Pharisees.}
\bv{25}{And they asked him, and said unto him, ``Why then baptisest thou, if thou art not the Christ, neither Elijah, neither the prophet?''}
\bv{26}{John answered them, saying, ``I baptise in water: in the midst of you standeth one whom ye know not,}
\bv{27}{\supptext{even} he that cometh after me, the latchet of whose shoe I am not worthy to unloose.''}
\bv{28}{These things were done in Bethany beyond the Jordan, where John was baptising.}
\bv{29}{On the morrow he seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, ``Behold, the Lamb of God, that taketh away the sin of the world!}
\bv{30}{This is he of whom I said, `After me cometh a man who is become before me: for he was before me.'}
\bv{31}{And I knew him not; but that he should be made manifest to Israel, for this cause came I baptising in water.''}
\bv{32}{And John bare witness, saying, ``I have beheld the Spirit descending as a dove out of heaven; and it abode upon him.}
\bv{33}{And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptise in water, he said unto me, `Upon whomsoever thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and abiding upon him, the same is he that baptiseth in the Holy Spirit.'}
\bv{34}{And I have seen, and have borne witness that this is the Son of God.''}
\bv{35}{Again on the morrow John was standing, and two of his disciples;}
\bv{36}{and he looked upon Jesus as he walked, and saith, ``Behold, the Lamb of God!''}
\bv{37}{And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus.}
\bv{38}{And Jesus turned, and beheld them following, and saith unto them, ``What seek ye?'' And they said unto him, ``Rabbi (which is to say, being interpreted, Teacher), where abidest thou?''}
\chapsec{The Calling of Sts. Peter, Andrew, etc.}
\bv{39}{He saith unto them, ``Come, and ye shall see.'' They came therefore and saw where he abode; and they abode with him that day: it was about the tenth hour.}
\bv{40}{One of the two that heard John \supptext{speak}, and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother.}
\bv{41}{He findeth first his own brother Simon, and saith unto him, ``We have found the Messiah'' (which is, being interpreted, Christ).}
\bv{42}{He brought him unto Jesus. Jesus looked upon him, and said, ``Thou art Simon the son of John: thou shalt be called Cephas'' (which is by interpretation, Peter).}
\bv{43}{On the morrow he was minded to go forth into Galilee, and he findeth Philip: and Jesus saith unto him, ``Follow me.''}
\bv{44}{Now Philip was from Bethsaida, of the city of Andrew and Peter.}
\bv{45}{Philip findeth Nathanael, and saith unto him, ``We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, wrote, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.''}
\bv{46}{And Nathanael said unto him, ``Can any good thing come out of Nazareth?'' Philip saith unto him, ``Come and see.''}
\bv{47}{Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and saith of him, ``Behold, an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!''}
\bv{48}{Nathanael saith unto him, ``Whence knowest thou me?'' Jesus answered and said unto him, ``Before Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee.''}
\bv{49}{Nathanael answered him, ``Rabbi, thou art the Son of God; thou art King of Israel.''}
\bv{50}{Jesus answered and said unto him, ``Because I said unto thee, I saw thee underneath the fig tree, believest thou? Thou shalt see greater things than these.''}
\bv{51}{And he saith unto him, ``Verily, verily, I say unto you, Ye shall see the heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.''}
