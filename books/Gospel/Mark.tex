\bv{49}{\redlet{I was daily with you in the temple teaching, and ye took me not: but \supptext{this is done} that the scriptures might be fulfilled.''}}

\chapter{Traditional Additions to Mark}
\chapdesc{Due to the short and abrupt ending of St. Mark's Gospel, these different endings have been added over time.}
\textit{The Shorter Ending}\\
They told all that had been commanded them briefly to those around Peter. After that, Jesus himself sent them out, from east to west, with the sacred and imperishable proclamation of eternal salvation.
\par
\noindent
\textit{The ``Freer Logion'' Ending}\\
And they made excuse, saying, ``This age of lawlessness and unbelief is under Satan, who by the unclean spirits does not allow men power to comprehend the truth of God. For this reason reveal thy righteousness now,'' they said to Christ.
\par
And Christ replied to them, ``The limit of the years of the power of Satan has been fulfilled, but other terrible things are near at hand. And I was delivered unto death on behalf of those who sinned, in order that they may return to the truth and sin no more, to the end that they may inherit the spiritual and incorruptible glory of righteousness (which glory is) in heaven. But go ye into all the world.''\par
\noindent
\textit{The Longer Ending}\\
{Now when he was risen early on the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, from whom he had cast out seven demons.}
{She went and told them that had been with him, as they mourned and wept.}
{And they, when they heard that he was alive, and had been seen of her, disbelieved.}
{And after these things he was manifested in another form unto two of them, as they walked, on their way into the country.}
{And they went away and told it unto the rest: neither believed they them.}
\par
{And afterward he was manifested unto the eleven themselves as they sat at meat; and he upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they believed not them that had seen him after he was risen.}
{And he said unto them, ``Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to the whole creation.}
{He that believeth and is baptised shall be saved; but he that disbelieveth shall be condemned.}
{And these signs shall accompany them that believe: in my name shall they cast out demons; they shall speak with new tongues;}
{they shall take up serpents, and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall in no wise hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover.''}
\par
{So then the Lord Jesus, after he had spoken unto them, was received up into heaven, and sat down at the right hand of God.}
{And they went forth, and preached everywhere, the Lord working with them, and confirming the word by the signs that followed. Amen.}
