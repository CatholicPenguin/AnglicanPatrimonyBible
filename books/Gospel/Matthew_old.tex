\chapsec{He was conceived by the Holy Ghost, and born of the ever-Virgin Mary when she was espoused to Joseph.}

\chapsec{The angel satisfieth the misjudging thoughts of Joseph, and interpreteth the names of Christ.}
\bv{19}{And Joseph her husband, being a righteous man, and not willing to make her a public example, was minded to put her away privily.}

\bv{21}{And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name {\scshape{Jesus}}, for it is he that shall save his people from their sins.''}
\bv{22}{Now all this is come to pass, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying,}
\qv{Is. 7:14}{Behold, \mcomm{One kind of prophecy proceeds from the Divine predestination, and must in all respects be accomplished so that its fulfilment is independent of our will, for instance the one in question.

\bv{11}{I indeed baptise you in water unto repentance, but he that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear. He shall baptise you in the Holy Ghost and \supptext{in} fire,}
