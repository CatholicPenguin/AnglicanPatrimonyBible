\chapsec{His Pre-Incarnation Work}
\bv{3}{All things were made through him; and without him was not anything made that hath been made.}

\chapsec{The Witness of St. John the Baptist}
\bv{15}{John beareth witness of him, and crieth, saying, ``This was he of whom I said, `He that cometh after me is become before me: for he was before me.' ''}
\bv{16}{For of his fulness we all received, and grace for grace.}
\bv{17}{For the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.}
\bv{18}{No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten God, who is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared \supptext{him}.}
\par
\bv{19}{And this is the witness of John, when the Jews sent unto him from Jerusalem priests and Levites to ask him, ``Who art thou?''}
\bv{20}{And he confessed, and denied not; and he confessed, ``I am not the Christ.''}
\bv{21}{And they asked him, ``What then? Art thou Elijah?'' And he saith, ``I am not.'' ``Art thou the prophet?'' And he answered, ``No.''}
\bv{22}{They said therefore unto him, ``Who art thou? that we may give an answer to them that sent us. What sayest thou of thyself?''}
\bv{23}{He said, ``I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, `Make straight the way of the Lord,' as said Isaiah the prophet.''\mref{Is. 40:3}}
\bv{24}{And they had been sent from the Pharisees.}
\bv{25}{And they asked him, and said unto him, ``Why then baptisest thou, if thou art not the Christ, neither Elijah, neither the prophet?''}
\bv{26}{John answered them, saying, ``I baptise in water: in the midst of you standeth one whom ye know not,}
\bv{27}{\supptext{even} he that cometh after me, the latchet of whose shoe I am not worthy to unloose.''}
\bv{28}{These things were done in Bethany beyond the Jordan, where John was baptising.}
\par
\bv{29}{On the morrow he seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, ``Behold, the Lamb of God, that taketh away the sin of the world!}
\bv{30}{This is he of whom I said, `After me cometh a man who is become before me: for he was before me.'}
\bv{31}{And I knew him not; but that he should be made manifest to Israel, for this cause came I baptising in water.''}
\bv{32}{And John bare witness, saying, ``I have beheld the Spirit descending as a dove out of heaven; and it abode upon him.}
\bv{33}{And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptise in water, he said unto me, `Upon whomsoever thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and abiding upon him, the same is he that baptiseth in the Holy Ghost.'}
\bv{34}{And I have seen, and have borne witness that this is the Son of God.''}
\par
\bv{35}{Again on the morrow John was standing, and two of his disciples;}
\bv{36}{and he looked upon Jesus as he walked, and saith, ``Behold, the Lamb of God!''}
\bv{37}{And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus.}
\bv{38}{And Jesus turned, and beheld them following, and saith unto them, \redlet{``What seek ye?''} And they said unto him, ``Rabbi'' (which is to say, being interpreted, ``Teacher''), ``where abidest thou?''}
\bv{39}{He saith unto them, \redlet{	``Come, and ye shall see.''} They came therefore and saw where he abode; and they abode with him that day: it was about the tenth hour.}
\bv{40}{One of the two that heard John \supptext{speak}, and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother.}
\bv{41}{He findeth first his own brother Simon, and saith unto him, ``We have found the Messiah'' (which is, being interpreted, ``Christ'').}
\bv{42}{He brought him unto Jesus. Jesus looked upon him, and said, \redlet{``Thou art Simon the son of John: thou shalt be called Cephas''} (which is by interpretation, ``Peter'').}
\bv{43}{On the morrow he was minded to go forth into Galilee, and he findeth Philip: and Jesus saith unto him, \redlet{``Follow me.''}}
\bv{44}{Now Philip was from Bethsaida, of the city of Andrew and Peter.}
\bv{45}{Philip findeth Nathanael, and saith unto him, ``We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, wrote, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.''}
\bv{46}{And Nathanael said unto him, ``Can any good thing come out of Nazareth?'' Philip saith unto him, ``Come and see.''}
\bv{47}{Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and saith of him, \redlet{``Behold, an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!''}}
\bv{48}{Nathanael saith unto him, ``Whence knowest thou me?'' Jesus answered and said unto him, \redlet{``Before Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee.''}}
\bv{49}{Nathanael answered him, ``Rabbi, thou art the Son of God; thou art King of Israel.''}
\bv{50}{Jesus answered and said unto him, \redlet{``Because I said unto thee, I saw thee underneath the fig tree, believest thou? thou shalt see greater things than these.''}}

\bv{3}{And when the wine failed, the mother of Jesus saith unto him, ``They have no wine.''}
\bv{4}{And Jesus saith unto her, \redlet{``Woman, what have I to do with thee? mine hour is not yet come.''}}
\bv{5}{His mother saith unto the servants, ``Whatsoever he saith unto you, do it.''}
\bv{6}{Now there were six waterpots of stone set there after the Jews' manner of purifying, containing two or three firkins apiece.}
\bv{7}{Jesus saith unto them, \redlet{``Fill the waterpots with water.''} And they filled them up to the brim.}
\bv{8}{And he saith unto them, \redlet{``Draw out now, and bear unto the ruler of the feast.''} And they bare it.}
\bv{9}{And when the ruler of the feast tasted the water now become wine, and knew not whence it was (but the servants that had drawn the water knew), the ruler of the feast calleth the bridegroom,}
\bv{10}{and saith unto him, ``Every man setteth on first the good wine; and when \supptext{men} have drunk freely, \supptext{then} that which is worse: thou hast kept the good wine until now.''}
\bv{11}{This beginning of his signs did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested his glory; and his disciples believed on him.}
\par
\bv{12}{After this he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, and \supptext{his} brethren, and his disciples; and there they abode not many days.}
\bv{13}{And the passover of the Jews was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.}
\bv{14}{And he found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the changers of money sitting:}
\bv{15}{and he made a scourge of cords, and cast all out of the temple, both the sheep and the oxen; and he poured out the changers' money, and overthrew their tables;}
\bv{16}{and to them that sold the doves he said, \redlet{``Take these things hence; make not my Father's house a house of merchandise.''}}
\bv{17}{His disciples remembered that it was written, \otQuote{Ps.69:9}{Zeal for thy house shall eat me up.}}
\bv{18}{The Jews therefore answered and said unto him, ``What sign showest thou unto us, seeing that thou doest these things?''}
\bv{19}{Jesus answered and said unto them, \redlet{``Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.''}}
\bv{20}{The Jews therefore said, ``Forty and six years was this temple in building, and wilt thou raise it up in three days?''}
\bv{21}{But he spake of the temple of his body.}
\bv{22}{When therefore he was raised from the dead, his disciples remembered that he spake this; and they believed the scripture, and the word which Jesus had said.}
\bv{23}{Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, during the feast, many believed on his name, beholding his signs which he did.}
\bv{24}{But Jesus did not trust himself unto them, for that he knew all men,}
\bv{25}{and because he needed not that any one should bear witness concerning man; for he himself knew what was in man.}

\bv{2}{the same came unto him by night, and said to him, ``Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from God; for no one can do these signs that thou doest, except God be with him.''}
\bv{3}{Jesus answered and said unto him, \redlet{``Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except one be born anew, he cannot see the kingdom of God.''}}
\bv{4}{Nicodemus saith unto him, ``How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter a second time into his mother's womb, and be born?''}
\bv{5}{Jesus answered, \redlet{``Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except one be born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.}}
\bv{6}{\redlet{That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.}}
\bv{7}{\redlet{Marvel not that I said unto thee, `Ye must be born anew.'}}

\par
\bv{9}{Nicodemus answered and said unto him, ``How can these things be?''}
\bv{10}{Jesus answered and said unto him, \redlet{``Art thou the teacher of Israel, and understandest not these things?}}
\bv{11}{\redlet{Verily, verily, I say unto thee, We speak that which we know, and bear witness of that which we have seen; and ye receive not our witness.}}
\bv{12}{\redlet{If I told you earthly things and ye believe not, how shall ye believe if I tell you heavenly things?}}
\bv{13}{\redlet{And no one hath ascended into heaven, but he that descended out of heaven, \supptext{even} the Son of man, who is in heaven.}}
\bv{14}{\redlet{And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up;}}
\bv{15}{\redlet{that whosoever believeth may in him have eternal life.}}
\par
\bv{16}{\redlet{For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth on him should not perish, but have eternal life.}}
\bv{17}{\redlet{For God sent not the Son into the world to judge the world; but that the world should be saved through him.}}
\bv{18}{\redlet{He that believeth on him is not judged: he that believeth not hath been judged already, because he hath not believed on the name of the only begotten Son of God.}}
\bv{19}{\redlet{And this is the judgement, that the light is come into the world, and men loved the darkness rather than the light; for their works were evil.}}
\bv{20}{\redlet{For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, and cometh not to the light, lest his works should be reproved.}}
\bv{21}{\redlet{But he that doeth the truth cometh to the light, that his works may be made manifest, that they have been wrought in God.''}}
\par
\bv{22}{After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of Judæa; and there he tarried with them, and baptised.}
\bv{23}{And John also was baptising in Ænon near to Salim, because there was much water there: and they came, and were baptised.}
\bv{24}{For John was not yet cast into prison.}
\bv{25}{There arose therefore a questioning on the part of John's disciples with a Jew about purifying.}
\bv{26}{And they came unto John, and said to him, ``Rabbi, he that was with thee beyond the Jordan, to whom thou hast borne witness, behold, the same baptiseth, and all men come to him.''}
\bv{27}{John answered and said, ``A man can receive nothing, except it have been given him from heaven.}
\bv{28}{Ye yourselves bear me witness, that I said, `I am not the Christ,' but, that I am sent before him.}
\bv{29}{He that hath the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom, that standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom's voice: this my joy therefore is made full.}
\bv{30}{He must increase, but I must decrease.}
\chapsec{Declaration about Jesus Christ}
\bv{31}{He that cometh from above is above all: he that is of the earth is of the earth, and of the earth he speaketh: he that cometh from heaven is above all.}
\bv{32}{What he hath seen and heard, of that he beareth witness; and no man receiveth his witness.}
\bv{33}{He that hath received his witness hath set his seal to \supptext{this}, that God is true.}
\bv{34}{For he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God: for he giveth not the Spirit by measure.}
\bv{35}{The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand.}
\bv{36}{He that believeth on the Son hath eternal life; but he that obeyeth not the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abideth on him.''}

\bv{5}{So he cometh to a city of Samaria, called Sychar, near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph:}
\chapsec{Jesus \& the Samaritan Woman}

\chapsec{The Indwelling Spirit}

\par
\bv{16}{Jesus saith unto her, \redlet{``Go, call thy husband, and come hither.''}}
\bv{17}{The woman answered and said unto him, ``I have no husband.'' Jesus saith unto her, \redlet{``Thou saidst well, I have no husband:}}
\bv{18}{\redlet{for thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband: this hast thou said truly.''}}
\par
\bv{19}{The woman saith unto him, ``Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet.}

\bv{21}{Jesus saith unto her, \redlet{``Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when neither in this mountain, nor in Jerusalem, shall ye worship the Father.}}
\bv{22}{\redlet{Ye worship that which ye know not: we worship that which we know; for salvation is from the Jews.}}

\par
\bv{27}{And upon this came his disciples; and they marvelled that he was speaking with a woman; yet no man said, ``What seekest thou?'' or, ``Why speakest thou with her?''}

\bv{29}{``Come, see a man, who told me all things that \supptext{ever} I did: can this be the Christ?''}

\bv{5}{Jesus therefore lifting up his eyes, and seeing that a great multitude cometh unto him, saith unto Philip, \redlet{``Whence are we to buy bread, that these may eat?''}}

\bv{12}{and she beholdeth two angels in white sitting, one at the head, and one at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain.}
\bv{13}{And they say unto her, ``Woman, why weepest thou?'' She saith unto them, ``Because they have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid him.''}
\bv{14}{When she had thus said, she turned herself back, and beholdeth Jesus standing, and knew not that it was Jesus.}
\bv{15}{Jesus saith unto her, \redlet{``Woman, why weepest thou? whom seekest thou?''} She, supposing him to be the gardener, saith unto him, ``Sir, if thou hast borne him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away.''}
\bv{16}{Jesus saith unto her, \redlet{``Mary.''} She turneth herself, and saith unto him in Hebrew, ``Rabboni;'' which is to say, ```Teacher.''}
\bv{17}{Jesus saith to her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended unto the Father: but go unto my brethren, and say to them, I ascend unto my Father and your Father, and my God and your God.}

\bv{20}{And when he had said this, he showed unto them his hands and his side. The disciples therefore were glad, when they saw the Lord.}
\bv{21}{Jesus therefore said to them again, \redlet{``Peace \supptext{be} unto you: as the Father hath sent me, even so send I you.''}}
\bv{22}{And when he had said this, he breathed on them, and saith unto them, \redlet{``Receive ye the Holy Ghost:}}

\bv{26}{And after eight days again his disciples were within, and Thomas with them. Jesus cometh, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst, and said, \redlet{``Peace \supptext{be} unto you.''}}

\chapter{The Woman Caught in Adultery}
\chapdesc{The story of the woman caught in adultery \textit{(pericope adulterae)} traditionally has been inserted into either St. John's or St. Luke's Gospel. It is likely a common historical story shared by early Christians about Our Lord.}
And they went every man unto his own house: but Jesus went unto the mount of Olives. And early in the morning he came again into the temple, and all the people came unto him; and he sat down, and taught them. And the scribes and the Pharisees bring a woman taken in adultery; and having set her in the midst, they say unto him, ``Teacher, this woman hath been taken in adultery, in the very act. Now in the law Moses commanded us to stone such: what then sayest thou of her?''
\par
And this they said, trying him, that they might have \supptext{whereof} to accuse him. But Jesus stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground. But when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said unto them, ``He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.'' And again he stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground. And they, when they heard it, went out one by one, beginning from the eldest, \supptext{even} unto the last: and Jesus was left alone, and the woman, where she was, in the midst.
\par
And Jesus lifted up himself, and said unto her, ``Woman, where are they? did no man condemn thee?'' And she said, ``No man, Lord.'' And Jesus said, ``Neither do I condemn thee: go thy way; from henceforth sin no more.''
